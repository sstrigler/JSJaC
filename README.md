JSJaC - JavaScript Jabber Client Library
========================================

JSJaC is a Jabber/XMPP client library written in JavaScript to ease
implementation of web based Jabber/XMPP clients. For communication
with a jabber server it needs to support either [HTTP Polling][1] or
[XMPP Over BOSH][2] (formerly known as HTTP Binding) or [XMPP Over
WebSocket][3].
JSJaC has an object oriented interface which should be quite easy to
use.
Communication is done by using the HTTPRequest object (also refered to
as AJAX technology) or WebSocket. Your browser must support this.
JSJaC is fully compatible with all major AJAX/JavaScript frameworks
like prototype, mootools, jQuery, dojo and YUI!.

**Note**: As security restrictions of most modern browsers prevent
  HTTP Polling from being usable anymore this module is disabled by
  default now. If you want to compile it in use
  Makefile.http\_polling.

Hints on Usage
--------------

### Service Address

Due to security restrictions you may have to forward or proxy requests
to your jabber server's service address.

Let's say your JSJaC based web application is located at
http://example.com/. Your Jabber server is at jabber.example.com and
it's HTTP Binding service is located at
http://jabber.example.org:5280/.

As most browser don't allow scripts to connect to a different domain
and/or port as they have been loaded from you'd have to find a way how
to access this service at some URI hosted at http://example.com/.

If you're using apache you could use mod\_proxy and mod\_rewrite to do
this job for you:

    <VirtualHost *>
      Servername example.com
      DocumentRoot /var/www
      AddDefaultCharset UTF-8
      RewriteEngine On
      RewriteRule ^/http-bind/ http://jabber.example.com:5280/http-bind/ [P]
    </VirtualHost>

With this you'd end up having access to the Jabber server's service at
http://example.com/http-bind/ (the httpbase address).

### Debug Logger

JSJaCConnection supports use of [JSDebugger][4] which is available
separately.

JSJaC also ships with a class 'JSJaCConsoleLogger' which lets you log to
Firebug's and Safari's console.

### Example

For an example on how to use this library within your web application
please have to look at 'examples/simpleclient.html'.
